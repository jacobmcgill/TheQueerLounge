My website project is a test website for an LGBTQIA+ Discord server that I'm an administator in. We've talked about making a website before to consolidate all of our resources and for people to discover us through, though we haven't acted on it yet. I figured it would be a good project for me to play around with as I learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

I've included a navigation menu that expands and collapeses when you change the size of the viewport.
I've included a contact form that uses JavaScript to validate that the name, email, and question inputs are filled out
I've included an animation to the logo image on the home page of the site.
